While working on a baseline ML model for a side-project, I found that across different runs üß™ of my experiments, the results that my model was generating were not exactly reproducible i.e. I was not getting the same performance metrics for the same model configuration, despite having all the knobs in place.

After debugging for quite some time, I found that this snippet was the root of my problems :

```python
# create list of unique tokens using set
unique_tokens.extend(list(set(itertools.chain(*train_df.tokens.to_list()))))

config.VOCAB_SIZE = len(unique_tokens)

# create tokenizer mapping
token2id = {token : idx for idx, token in enumerate(unique_tokens)}
id2token = dict(enumerate(unique_tokens))
```

I was constructing the tokenizer mapping using the `set()` operation, this caused the same model i/o to be encoded & decoded differently each time.
And we‚Äôll see why.

### How set() works

First, we need to understand how `set()` is implemented in python. Internally a `set()` data structure is implemented using a hash table. A hash table by definition has a hash function, which takes in the input and maps the data to a unique bucket using the hash value, this is how it can do membership checking in `O(1)`.

When you call a `set()` on a `list` object, it returns unique values for the input that you provided. Internally to distinguish this **‚Äúuniqueness‚Äù** it uses the hash function we discussed above.

Converting a `list` into a `set` is easy, since for two similar values, both of them will map to the same exact hash bucket. However, this hash function is not always deterministic, particularly when dealing with string objects across two different python **invocations**. Let‚Äôs look at a few examples

```python
"""snippet1.py"""
# Snippet to get hash values

a = "1"
b = "abcde"
c = 1234
d = 6.4512

hv1 = hash(a)
hv2 = hash(b)
hv3 = hash(c)
hv4 = hash(d)

print(f"Hash value of {a} - {hv1}")
print(f"Hash value of {b} - {hv2}")
print(f"Hash value of {c} - {hv3}")
print(f"Hash value of {d} - {hv4}")
```

This is what I got from two different invocations of the script

```bash
$ python snippet1.py

Hash value of 1 - 1981388520896787279
Hash value of abcde - 4943320557970621589
Hash value of 1234 - 1234
Hash value of 6.4512 - 1040396365757218822
```

```bash
$ python snippet1.py

Hash value of 1 - -9001918643517506909
Hash value of abcde - -757009308147773598
Hash value of 1234 - 1234
Hash value of 6.4512 - 1040396365757218822
```

You can notice how I got different outputs across two different **invocations** of the script for the variables that are `string`. While the hash values for the numbers remained constant.

This is because of how internally hash function is implemented. For values of `str` and `byte` objects, the input to the hash function is salted with a random value to protect against certain denial of service attacks([source](https://docs.python.org/3.8/reference/datamodel.html#object.__hash__)). For the same python invocation, the value remains the same, as this **‚Äúsalting‚Äù** only happens at the first time you call the python executable.

**But how do these hash values link to the ordering of the sets ü§î**

In the `set()` data structure, after hashing is done for an object, python takes the last **N** bits of the hash value and uses them as **indices** to place the object in the memory. And when these values are retrieved from the memory, *they are yielded in the order that they exist in the memory <u>not the way they were put in.</u>*

**And what happens to the order when you have different hash values across different python invocations?**

Here‚Äôs an example to make the concept concrete:

```python
"""snippet2.py"""

l1 = [9,1,1,2,3,4,5,1,1,2]
l2 = ["def",2,3,4,"abc", "abc", "deg", "xyz"]

s1 = set(l1)
s2 = set(l2)

print(f"Set 1 - {set(s1)}")
print(f"Set 2 - {set(s2)}")
```

Output from two different invocations

```python
$ python snippet2.py

Set 1 - {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9}
Set 2 - {'xyz', 2, 3, 4, 'deg', 'def', 'abc'}
```

```python
$ python snippet2.py

Set 1 - {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9}
Set 2 - {2, 3, 4, 'def', 'abc', 'xyz', 'deg'}
```

You'll notice how for set 2 the ordering is different.

For the two separate runs, since the strings have different hash values, they have been mapped to different locations in the memory which then affected the ordering when it was yeilded from the memory. üí°

### Can this be fixed?

By virtue, python sets are [unordered](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets), so it is better if alternatives are explored,
As of Python 3.7+, [dicts](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict) are ordered, so a hack like this would work:

```python
sample_list = ["def",2,3,4,"abc", "abc", "deg", "xyz"]

sample_set = list(dict.fromkeys(sample_list))
```

This is how I modified my code
```python
# create list of unique tokens using dict
unique_tokens.extend(
    list(dict.fromkeys(itertools.chain(*_df.tokens.to_list())))
)

config.VOCAB_SIZE = len(unique_tokens)

# create tokenizer mapping
token2id = {token: idx for idx, token in enumerate(unique_tokens)}
id2token = dict(enumerate(unique_tokens))
```

If you still need to use `set` and preserve ordering across different runs([not recommended](https://docs.python.org/3.8/reference/datamodel.html#object.__hash__)), the env variable `PYTHONHASHSEED` can be [set](https://docs.python.org/3.5/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONHASHSEED) to `‚Äò0‚Äô`  to disable randomization.

```python
import os
import sys
hash_seed = os.getenv('PYTHONHASHSEED')
if not hash_seed:
    os.environ['PYTHONHASHSEED'] = '0'
    # Spaw a new/child process and run the same file
    os.execv(sys.executable, [sys.executable] + sys.argv)

# Your code below

l1 = [9,1,1,2,3,4,5,1,1,2]
l2 = ["def",2,3,4,"abc", "abc", "deg", "xyz"]

s1 = set(l1)
s2 = set(l2)

print(f"Set 1 - {set(s1)}")
print(f"Set 2 - {set(s2)}")
```
This snippet will turn off the randomization/salting that happens. This is done by setting a `env` variable and then spawning a new/child process which runs the same python file again. So that the new python invocation will use the value of the set `env` variable.
Running this snippet will give you the same ordering each time. Try it out : )
