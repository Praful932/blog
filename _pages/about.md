Currently working as a ML Engineer at [Prodigal](https://www.prodigaltech.com/) solving some interesting problems in the conversational space. My current interests lie in getting better outputs out of SLMs (<7B models) & low level design.


Prior to that I was an undergrad('22) 🎓 at [DYPCOE](https://www.dypcoeakurdi.ac.in/) studying computer science. While pursuing my undergrad, I worked on [multiple open-source projects](https://github.com/Praful932) with amazing collaborators.

During that time I also collaborated with [Omdena](https://omdena.com/) on AI projects with startups related to [healthcare](https://rebootrx.org/) and [energy](https://youtu.be/MnFkPazZULU). I also interned at [BimaPe(now Verak)](https://verak.in/welcome/) where I worked on information extraction.

When you don't find me coding/writing, I'll be
* [Reading](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/119895847?shelf=%23ALL%23) up on something
* Geeking out on [Anime](https://myanimelist.net/profile/SinizterChill) & Greek Mythology
* Learning Japanese 🍜

fun fact - I used to run a game zone🎮 with my own computer when I was 12 :)
